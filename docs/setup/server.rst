Setup the Patch Server Web Application
======================================

.. warning::

    These instructions do not cover securing your patch server with a TLS
    certificate for HTTPS connections.

.. note::

    You will need to have the ``pip`` and ``virtualenv`` commands installed to
    follow these instructions.

Testing the Patch Server
------------------------

.. warning::

    Using the included ``run.py`` script is not recommended for a production
    environment. See the other options below depending upon your platform.

Clone the project repository to the system that will run the application.

Change into the directory for the project, create a Python virtual environment,
and install the project requirements to it.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd /path/to/PatchServer
    $ virtualenv ./venv
    $ source ./venv/bin/activate
    (venv) $ pip install -r ./requirements.txt

Run the application.

.. code-block:: bash

    python run.py


You will be able to access the application using ``localhost`` or your
computer's IP address at port ``5000``.

Setting the Server up as a Service
----------------------------------



Running as a Docker Container
-----------------------------

In the ``installation/docker/`` directory of the project repository is a
``Dockerfile`` that can be used to launch the patch server as a container.

Clone the project repository to your computer. Create the Docker image with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd /path/to/PatchServer
    $ docker build --tag patchserver:latest -f installation/docker/Dockerfile .

If you have Docker installed, you can run the image with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ docker run -v /<patchserver-data>:/var/lib/patchserver -p 5000:5000 patchserver

.. note::

    Use the ``-d`` option to run the container in the background.

.. note::

    The ``-v /<patchserver-data>:/var/lib/patchserver`` option is to mount a
    local directory to the path in the running container where the persistent
    data for the patch server is stored (i.e. the database).

.. warning::

    If you do not attach a volume to ``/var/lib/patchserver`` the database will
    be erased when the container is stopped and removed.

You will be able to access the application using the IP address of the host
(your computer's IP address when running Docker locally) at port ``5000``.


Installation on macOS
---------------------

The following instructions are for setting up the patch server application on
a macOS system using ``mod_wsgi-express``.

Create a new directory in your ``/Library`` named ``PatchServer``. Clone the
project repository to this directory.

Write the following into a new file called ``patch_server.wsgi``:

.. note::

    Grant execute permissions on this file (mode ``755``).
    This file can be found in the repository at ``installation/macOS/``

.. code-block:: python

    import sys
    sys.path.insert(0, '/Library/PatchServer/')

    from patchserver.factory import create_app

    application = create_app()

In the Terminal, create a virtual environment within this directory called
``venv`` and install the project requirements.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd /Library/PatchServer
    $ virtualenv ./venv
    $ source ./venv/bin/activate
    (venv) $ pip install -r ./requirements.txt

Now install ``mod_wsgi`` into the environment (this process may take several
minutes):

.. code-block:: bash

    (venv) $ pip install mod_wsgi

Change the ownership of the ``/Library/PatchServer`` directory to the ``_www``
user and group (the server will be run as this user and **must** have read/write
access to this directory):

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo chown -R _www:_www /Library/PatchServer

Now, in a new Terminal window in ``/Library/PatchServer``, create a command line
utility to run and manage the apache server with:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo venv/bin/mod_wsgi-express setup-server patch_server.wsgi --port=5000 --user _www --group _www --server-root=/usr/local/bin/patchserver

You can now launch the application using the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo /usr/local/bin/patchserver/apachectl start

To launch the patch server automatically when the system boots, write the
following launch daemon to ``/Library/LaunchDaemons/com.patchserver.daemon.plist``.

.. note::

    This launch daemon should be owned by ``root:wheel`` with mode ``644``.
    This file can be found in the repository at ``installation/macOS/``

.. code-block:: xml

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
    <plist version="1.0">
        <dict>
            <key>Label</key>
            <string>com.patchserver.daemon</string>
            <key>ProgramArguments</key>
            <array>
                <string>/usr/local/bin/patchserver/apachectl</string>
                <string>start</string>
            </array>
            <key>RunAtLoad</key>
            <true/>
            <key>KeepAlive</key>
            <true/>
        </dict>
    </plist>

The following file tree shows the locations of all the **required** files and
resources copied or created during these steps::

    /
    ├── Library/
    │   ├── PatchServer/                         <-- Owned by _www:_www
    │   │   ├── venv/                            <-- Python virtual environment

You will be able to access the application using ``localhost`` or your
computer's IP address at port ``5000``.
